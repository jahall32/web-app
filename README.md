Web App concept

A social media app that is based around uploading memes (possibly videos, but defintley pictures). Ideally i would like for users to upload memes straight from their libuary, but if its possible i would like for them to be able edit defualt templates that i have stored on a database. Users will be able to like and comment on posts. For the people posting i would like for them to be able to add a description of their meme. If i have time i would like for them to also add a filter key word, so that the memes could be filtered by themes, e.g Cats.  



Suggested data structure 

- I'll need a database to store user data, and the pre-existing meme templates.

- something to store images and videos. there are multiple ways to do this, so im unsure at the moment what one is best. They would be stored on a local     directory, database or a cloud service.
